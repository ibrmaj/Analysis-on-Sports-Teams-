# Analysis on Sports Teams

This project is part of Assignment 4, which involves analyzing data from the "Big 4" sports leagues (NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL) to identify correlations between league-specific variables.

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to:

- Explore the relationship between key variables in each of the four sports leagues.
- Perform correlation analysis on the data and visualize the findings.
- Apply statistical and programming skills to clean, manipulate, and analyze large datasets.

## Features

### League-Specific Correlation Analysis:
Analyze relationships such as:
- **NBA**: Team salary vs. wins
- **NHL**: Goal differential vs. points
- **MLB**: Run differential vs. winning percentage
- **NFL**: Point differential vs. wins

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Remove unnecessary columns, handle missing data, and ensure datasets are in a usable format.

### Visualizations:
- Generate scatter plots with regression lines to depict correlations clearly.

### Summary Statistics:
- Compute and interpret Pearson correlation coefficients for each league's variables.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
    - `pandas` for data manipulation
    - `matplotlib`  for data visualization
    - `numpy` for statistical calculations
- **Dataset Sources**: League-specific performance and financial data for NBA, NHL, MLB, and NFL.
